 -- wat --

    Originally written for a college assignment in 2007.
    Until today, it has been ignored since I submitted it.

    Here is, essentially, the final program I submitted,
    but with some very minor changes:

        - the name is now 'wat' (originally it was just 'markov')
        - code formatting has been changed slightly
          (mostly just changing tabs to spaces -- I've become
           one of THOSE people)
        - license information has been added

    I'm pushing it to GitHub in the hopes that I'll start
    working on it again some time. First I need to relearn C++...
